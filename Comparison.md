As expected, the AStar approach runs much faster than the repeated MAPF solver. When AStar does not hit deadlocks on intersections with 10 agents, AStar takes about 0.054 seconds (on the large 4-way intersection with eac road being 3-lanes wide - this corresponds to a 31x31 size intersection). On the same graphs, repeated MAPF takes about 0.5 seconds. By comparison, when there are 40 agents, AStar takes just 0.08 seconds whereas repeated MAPF takes anywhere between 1.5 to 6 seconds. Repeated MAPF appears to be very slow on especially dense intersections, which emphasizes the need to move to an incremental version. Something interesting to note is that when AStar does not hit a deadlock, AStar consistently produces equal or better throughput than repeated MAPF, and this holds true for about 50 different randomly generated test cases of up to 45 agents (for cases of more than 40 agents, the vast majority either timed out for repeated MAPF or deadlocked on the AStar).
